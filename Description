RedFlag Simulator is a legally compliant, white-hat tool designed to simulate ransomware attacks for cybersecurity awareness training, penetration testing drills, and incident response preparedness. It generates realistic but fully fake "leaked" data (browser history, social media activity) and mimics ransomware behavior without harming real systems.

Key Features
‚úÖ Safe Simulation

Generates synthetic "compromised" data (JSON logs).

Fake ransomware popup with auto-revert (60s timeout).

‚úÖ Training-Focused

Tests employee/team responses to data breach scenarios.

Post-simulation reports for debriefing.

‚úÖ Admin Controls

Password-protected kill-switch (whitehat).

Clear disclaimers to avoid confusion with real attacks.

‚úÖ Customizable

Adjust fake data types (e.g., finance/HR records for HIPAA/GDPR drills).

Use Cases
üè¢ Enterprise Security Teams: Run quarterly ransomware drills.

üéì Universities: Teach students incident response.

üõ°Ô∏è Government/Military: Red-team exercises (requires authorization).

‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimers

Contribute
PRs welcome! Guidelines:

Code must include no real data collection.

Add unit tests for new features.
