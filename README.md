# cyber-research
This repository will be filled with my research on Cyber Warfare, Cyber Weapon Development, Cyber Security, and more in that field. Still, this repository will be private, and "This repository contains malware code for educational and non-operational purposes only. It is not meant for deployment or malicious use." All of the research is going to be mostly theory and custom due to my writing the code and ideas in a notebook and transferring it to text files under strict control
Also i will have 20 ideas in my notebook and transfer them all at one time
